MakeToMove is an interactive physical art piece built as a geodesic dome to encourage people to move and have fun while doing it!
It was made with folks at the Hatch Makerspace in Watertown Massachusetts.

Prolonged sitting can have many negative effects on the human body.

Heart Disease: Lack of physical activity can lead to cardiovascular disease. Lower Back & Spine: Sitting increases stress on (and reduces flexibility of) the spine and can lead to osteoporosis. Obesity: Increased sitting is linked to weight gain and diabetes. Vascular Problems: Too much time in a chair can lead to blood clots and, in serious cases, deep vein thrombosis."/>

In an ever-more sedentary life, it's important to get up and move (wrote the person who has been sitting in his chair for 4 hours straight)!

Here it is in action:

In this project our focus was on the _fun_ of moving. The dome consisted of:
 - A **soccer game** where you can kick the ball with your body (works by camera detecting image differences).
 - A stepping and cycling **exercise machines** on opposite side which when operated, lights up panels up to 4 lights, then triggers the **bubbling machine**
 - A set of capacitive buttons built with aluminum foil which play a sound on touch, and where you can choose between various **musical instruments**.
